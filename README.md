**Scrolling Buddha** is a place where you can find answer for the question "When to start improve yourself?"
Just scroll down deeper and deeper, and you will see an answer (or swipe down, if you use mobile device).

Implemented using only HTML + CSS.

(the app doesn't work on Firefox browser. Seems like it doesn't support **animation-timeline** feature)
