**Scrolling Buddha** is a place where you can find answer for the question "When to start improve yourself?"
Just scroll down deeper and deeper, and you will see an answer (or swipe, if you use mobile device).

Implemented using only HTML + CSS.

The app doesn't work on Firefox browser. **animation-timeline** feature isn't supported by default. 
But you can turn it on: in address bar, write: 
1. *about:config*
2. *Accept all ristks*
3. *layout.css.scroll-driven-animations.enabled*
